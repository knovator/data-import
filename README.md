It is difficult when you want to change your ERP System. The first problem will be getting your old system's data into the new system.

For that, we have developed a separate functionality where the user will be able to do that. In Data Import, users can configure templates based on their Excel/CSV data files and get data from Excel/CSV files.

The project is still in development, but the basic functionality is ready.
For any issue or better suggestions then you're welcome to send PR instead of suggesting ðŸ˜œ.
